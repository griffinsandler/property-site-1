    <p>
        One of your tenants has sent you a service request:
        <ul>
            <li>Property: Home</li>
            <li>Address: 2224 Calhoun Street</li>
            <li>Requester: Griffin Sandler</li>
            <li>Subject: Problems</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Active Job&#39;s default behavior is to execute jobs via the :async adapter. So, you can use deliver_later now to send emails asynchronously. Active Job&#39;s default adapter runs jobs with an in-process thread pool. It&#39;s well-suited for the development/test environments, since it doesn&#39;t require any external infrastructure, but it&#39;s a poor fit for production since it drops pending jobs on restart. If you need a persistent backend, you will need to use an Active Job adapter that has a persistent backend (Sidekiq, Resque, etc).

    <p>
        One of your tenants has sent you a service request:
        <ul>
            <li>Property: Home</li>
            <li>Address: 2224 Calhoun Street</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Active Job&#39;s default behavior is to execute jobs via the :async adapter. So, you can use deliver_later now to send emails asynchronously. Active Job&#39;s default adapter runs jobs with an in-process thread pool. It&#39;s well-suited for the development/test environments, since it doesn&#39;t require any external infrastructure, but it&#39;s a poor fit for production since it drops pending jobs on restart. If you need a persistent backend, you will need to use an Active Job adapter that has a persistent backend (Sidekiq, Resque, etc).

    <h1>Dear Charlie Powicki,</h1>
    <p>
        One of your tenants has sent you a service request:
        <ul>
            <li>Property: Home</li>
            <li>Address: 2224 Calhoun Street</li>
            <li>Requester: Griffin Sandler</li>
            <li>Subject: Problem</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Active Job&#39;s default behavior is to execute jobs via the :async adapter. So, you can use deliver_later now to send emails asynchronously. Active Job&#39;s default adapter runs jobs with an in-process thread pool. It&#39;s well-suited for the development/test environments, since it doesn&#39;t require any external infrastructure, but it&#39;s a poor fit for production since it drops pending jobs on restart. If you need a persistent backend, you will need to use an Active Job adapter that has a persistent backend (Sidekiq, Resque, etc).
    </p>
    <p>
        To respond to this request, please follow this link: <a href = "/services/show/10" />
